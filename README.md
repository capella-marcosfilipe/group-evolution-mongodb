## 📝 About the project

This project was created to practice Mongoose in Express.js projects. I created it as practice for an Express.js and MongoDB course I took from Alura.com.br.

As an ESL teacher, I have to keep track of my classes. My school provides me with an online teacher planner called "group evolution" (hence the name of my project). Every teacher in my school uses it a little bit different and in this project I gave it a take on how I am the most comfortable with using it.

## 🏓 Goals

I wish to make it a full-stack project. I want to create a full diary for private tutors in ESL to be able to create their groups, enroll students and register their classes in their planners.

So far, those are my steps:

- [x] Create an API for MongoDB;
- [ ] Create an interface in React.js;
- [ ] Publish it.
